Welcome to my 6002CEM Mobile App development Coursework 2.


ToDo List App is a kind of app that generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list
and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed.


This app was developed using xamarin.forms MVVM Archeticture pattern and Firebase. Users' data can be securely stored on the Firebase cloud because Firebase was utilised on the application. Users can create accounts and login to this app to create daily tasks and organise them into lists. This app is available in both a light and a dark theme.
